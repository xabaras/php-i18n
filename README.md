Here follows a brief description of what is php-i18n and how to get it to work properly.

### What is php-i18n ###

php-i18n is an internationalization library for php web applications, it is aimed to help developers getting rid of custom code when dealing with website localizations.


### How do I get set up? ###

It is simple to getting started with php-i18n you should simply:

* Deploy the php-i18n directory anywhere you want on a php enabled server
* Fill in the proper configuration values in the "CONFIGUIRATION SECTION" in the "php-i18n / php-i18n.php" file
* Add localization files to the l10n directory

## CONFIGURATION ##

In the "CONFIGURATION SECTION" of the "php-i18n/php-i18n.php" file you'll find the following configuration options:

```
#!php

/* Path where php-i18n library is placed */
$phpi18n_PATH = $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"] . "/php-i18n/php-i18n/";

/* Path where localization files (es: strings_en.l10n) are placed */
$l10n_PATH = $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"] . "/php-i18n/php-i18n/l10n/";

/* Default language (two letters ISO 639-1 code) for the webapp (the matching file must exist) */
$DEFAULT_LANGUAGE="en";

/* Says whether to choose current language based on client or not  */
$DETECT_CURRENT_LANGUAGE=true;
```
## Localization files ##

You can write a localization file for each language. Localization files (extension .l10n) are automatically detected from the l10n directory provided that their name is strings_xx.l10n, where "xx" is the two letters ISO 639-1 code of the laguage to which the translation refers to.

Localization files use the Java [Property Resources Bundle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties) file format:


```
#!properties

# Default l10n file
hello_world=Hello %s, this page is in English
lblYourLanguage=Your language is:
lblAvailable=Available languages:
lblSetLanguage=Change language
lblJsSample=Click here to run a JavaScript call sample
msgJsSample=Hello %s, this is a JavaScript call sample

# Language specific keys, don't remove
country_code=US
locale=en_US
```
N.B. You must specify and never remove country_code and locale properties in each localization file.
